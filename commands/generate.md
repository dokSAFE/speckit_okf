# /speckit.okf.generate — Bootstrap an OKF knowledge bundle

You are acting as an **OKF enrichment agent**. Your job is to analyze this
repository and produce a conformant **Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.1)**
knowledge bundle: a directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter that
captures the metadata, context, and curated insight surrounding this codebase.

Spec: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md

User input (optional focus/scope hints):

$ARGUMENTS

## Phase 0 — Configuration and inventory

1. Load configuration from `.specify/extensions/okf/okf-config.yml` if
   it exists; otherwise use the defaults in `okf-config.template.yml`
   (`bundle_dir: knowledge/`, `granularity: medium`).
2. **Guard against clobbering curation.** If `bundle_dir` already exists
   and contains one or more `.md` files (whether or not `log.md` is
   present — a hand-seeded or partial bundle is still real curation),
   STOP here and tell the user to run `/speckit.okf.update` instead;
   regenerating from scratch would destroy that curation. Only proceed if
   the user explicitly asked for a full rebuild in $ARGUMENTS. If `bundle_dir` doesn't
   exist or is empty, continue.
3. Run the inventory script and read the path it prints (do not assume a
   fixed location — the script picks a per-run temp file to avoid
   collisions with concurrent runs):

   ```bash
   # if okf-config.yml exists, pass it so its exclude list is honored:
   .specify/extensions/okf/scripts/bash/okf-inventory.sh --config .specify/extensions/okf/okf-config.yml
   # otherwise run without --config to use the script's built-in defaults:
   .specify/extensions/okf/scripts/bash/okf-inventory.sh
   ```

   The script prints `Inventory written to <path>` — read the JSON from
   that path. It contains the file tree, languages, entry points,
   dependency manifests, schema/migration files, API definition files,
   CI/CD configs, existing docs, and ADR/design-decision docs
   (`adr_docs`), honoring the config's `exclude` list. Each category also
   carries a `truncated` flag (see the top-level `truncated` object) — if
   a category you need was truncated, either widen `exclude` in the config
   or ask the user before concluding you've seen the full picture for
   that category.
4. Note the **git history signals** under `git.history` in the inventory:
   - `churn` — files ranked by commit count (hottest first). Treat high
     churn as a **significance** signal in Phase 1 (a file touched by 40
     commits almost certainly deserves a concept and probably hides
     gotchas); treat near-zero churn as a hint the code may be trivial or
     generated.
   - `recent_commits` — recent non-merge subjects, a cheap first read on
     what the project has been doing lately.
   - `untracked_dirs` — directories present on disk that git does not
     track and `.gitignore` does not cover: a vendored dependency, an
     imported third-party project, generated output. **Treat these as
     off-limits.** Everything else in the inventory comes from
     `git ls-files`, so these paths are deliberately absent from it. Never
     write a concept whose `source_files` point into one, and do not go
     exploring them with your own file tools: code the repository does not
     track has no history behind it, so every "why" you write about it is
     unsupported, and the verifier will reject the concept (V8). Name them
     in your report instead — "skipped `vendor/foo/` (952 untracked
     files)" — and ask whether any should be documented separately. If so,
     the fix is to track the subtree or catalog it as its own repository,
     not to fold it into this bundle.
   - Use these to prioritize; pull the deeper per-concept "why" in Phase 2
     with `okf-history.sh` (below). If `git.is_git_repo` is `false`,
     `git.history` is empty — skip history-based reasoning rather than
     inventing it, take `timestamp` from file modification time, and expect
     to raise more `open_questions`, because without history the \"why\" can
     only come from a human.
5. Determine `resource_base`: from config, else from
   `git remote get-url origin` + default branch (convert SSH form to an
   `https://.../blob/<branch>/{path}` form). If the repo has no remote,
   omit `resource:` fields entirely rather than inventing URIs.

## Phase 1 — Concept planning (do this BEFORE writing files)

Read the inventory plus key files (READMEs, entry points, route
definitions, schema files, docker/CI configs) and draft a **concept plan**:
a table of `concept_id | type | title | one-line description | source files`.

Selection rules by granularity (default: medium):

- Always: one `architecture/overview.md` concept (type: `Reference`)
  describing the system's purpose, high-level structure, and how the
  pieces fit together — with links to every other top-level concept.
- One concept per **deployable unit / service / app** (type: `Service`).
- One concept per **significant module or package** — significant means it
  has a coherent responsibility a new engineer would need explained, not
  merely that a directory exists (type: `Module`).
- One concept per **API surface**: group endpoints by resource or router
  file, not one file per endpoint unless granularity=fine
  (type: `API Endpoint` or `API Resource`).
- One concept per **data model / database table / event schema** found in
  migrations, ORM models, .proto/.avsc/OpenAPI schemas (type:
  `Data Model` / `Database Table`).
- One concept per **operational artifact** worth explaining: CI pipeline,
  deployment config, cron/scheduled jobs (type: `Pipeline`,
  `Configuration`).
- Optionally: `operations/` playbooks if the repo contains runbook-like
  docs; mirror external references into `references/` when the code links
  to essential external documents.
- Seed a `Design Decision` concept (in `architecture/`) for each ADR/RFC
  found in `adr_docs`, and mirror truly external decision records into
  `references/`.

Every concept must describe **git-tracked** code. If a path is not in
`git ls-files`, it does not get a concept.

**Use co-change to find what churn and imports both miss.** Run:

```bash
python3 .specify/extensions/okf/scripts/python/okf-cochange.py --depth 2          # repo-wide: most coupled units
python3 .specify/extensions/okf/scripts/python/okf-cochange.py <dir> --depth 3    # what moves when this moves
```

Two units that keep appearing in the same commit are coupled even when
neither imports the other — a shared schema, a wire contract, a deployment
ordering rule. Read the `lift` column, not just `confidence`: a directory
that changes constantly co-occurs with everything at a lift near 1 and means
nothing, while a lift of 5+ on decent support is a real relationship. A
high-lift partner with no concept of its own is usually a missing concept;
one that no import explains is worth writing down in Phase 2.

**Use churn to break significance ties.** When deciding whether a
borderline module/file warrants its own concept, consult `git.history.churn`
from the inventory: high-churn files are both more important to explain and
more likely to carry hard-won gotchas, so bias toward giving them a concept
(and a richer "why" section). Do not create concepts for high-churn files
that are pure noise (logs, generated data, fixtures) — significance is about
*coherent responsibility*, not commit count alone.

Present this plan to the user briefly (the table), then proceed — do not
wait for approval unless the plan exceeds ~40 concepts, in which case ask
whether to coarsen granularity.

## Phase 2 — Write the bundle

Create the bundle under `bundle_dir` following OKF §3–§8 exactly:

### Frontmatter (every concept file)

```yaml
---
type: <Type>                      # REQUIRED, non-empty
title: <Human-readable name>
description: <ONE sentence, used in indexes and previews>
resource: <resource_base with the primary source file path>   # omit for abstract concepts
tags: [<lowercase-tag>, ...]
timestamp: <ISO 8601 — the MOST RECENT commit time across this concept's source_files;
            get each with: git log -1 --format=%cI -- <path>, then take the latest.
            If a source file is untracked / has no git history, fall back to the current UTC time.>
source_files:                     # extension field: repo-relative paths this concept derives from
  - path/to/file.py
generated_by: speckit-okf/0.5.0   # producer extension (OKF §4.1)
open_questions:                   # extension field: unresolved uncertainties (omit if none)
  - "Is the retry budget in submit_order() a hard SLA or a heuristic? Source is ambiguous."
---
```

`source_files`, `generated_by`, and `open_questions` are producer extension
fields (permitted by OKF §4.1). `source_files` is what makes incremental
updates possible, so always include it. Using the *latest* commit time across
`source_files` for `timestamp` keeps it consistent with how
`/speckit.okf.update` and the validator detect staleness (they compare
`timestamp` against each `source_files` entry's last commit time).

`open_questions` is how you **park uncertainty instead of guessing**: when the
code (and its git history) don't let you state a fact confidently — an intent,
an invariant, a "why" — add a concrete, answerable question here rather than
inventing an answer. `/speckit.okf.clarify` collects these, asks the user, and
folds the answers back into the bodies. Omit the field entirely when a concept
has no open questions.

### Body conventions

- Favor **structural markdown** (headings, tables, fenced code) over prose.
- Use conventional headings where applicable: `# Schema` for
  columns/fields of data concepts, `# Examples` for usage snippets,
  `# Citations` for external sources (numbered, per OKF §8).
- Write what a **staff engineer would tell a new teammate**, not a
  file-by-file paraphrase: purpose, invariants, gotchas, why it is shaped
  the way it is (cite commit messages or ADRs when they explain a
  decision).
- Do NOT copy large source excerpts. Short illustrative snippets only.
- Do NOT include secrets, tokens, credentials, or internal hostnames
  found in the code. If a config file contains secrets, describe its
  shape, never its values.

### Required sections for `Service` and `Module` concepts

A concept that describes code MUST carry all four of the following. A
concept with only prose is not useful to a routing agent — it can neither
be checked against the code nor traversed to a neighbour.

**1. `# Responsibilities`** — two to four sentences. What this owns, and
the shape of its control flow (request handler? reconciler? batch job?).

**2. `# Interfaces` — extracted, not remembered.** A table of the actual
public surface. Derive it from the source; never write it from memory.
Grep the concept's `source_files` for exported declarations, e.g.:

```bash
# Go — exported funcs and methods, tests excluded
grep -rn --include='*.go' -E '^func ([A-Z]|\([^)]*\) [A-Z])' <dir> | grep -v '_test\.go'
# Python — module-level defs and classes
grep -rn --include='*.py' -E '^(def [a-z]|class [A-Z])' <dir>
# TypeScript / JavaScript
grep -rn --include='*.ts' --include='*.js' -E '^export (async )?(function|class|const)' <dir>
# Java / C#
grep -rn --include='*.java' --include='*.cs' -E '^\s*public (class|interface|[A-Za-z<>\[\]]+ [a-z])' <dir>
```

Then select — do not paste hundreds of rows. Drop test fixtures and
fakes (`testing/`, `fake_*`, `mock_*`), and keep the entries a caller
would actually reach for (roughly 5–15), one line each:

```markdown
# Interfaces

| Symbol | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SyncPod(pod, status)` | Drives one pod to its desired state; the main reconcile entry point. |
| `GetPodStatus(uid)` | Reads cached status; does not hit the runtime. |
```

If the surface is an HTTP or RPC API, list routes/methods instead of
symbols. If a concept genuinely has no public surface (a leaf helper),
say so in one line rather than omitting the heading.

**3. `# Dependencies` — derived from imports.** Do not guess the graph;
read it. Extract the concept's internal imports, then map each imported
path to the concept whose `source_files` contains it, and emit a
bundle-relative link:

```bash
# Go
grep -rh --include='*.go' -A40 '^import (' <dir> | grep -oE '"[a-z0-9./-]+/[a-z0-9./-]+"' | sort -u
# Python
grep -rhE --include='*.py' '^(from|import) ' <dir> | sort -u
# TypeScript / JavaScript
grep -rhoE --include='*.ts' --include='*.js' "from ['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" <dir> | sort -u
```

Every internal import that resolves to another concept becomes a link,
with the relationship named in prose ("calls", "reads from", "publishes
to"). List external packages separately, unlinked. This is what makes the
bundle traversable rather than a pile of independent files.

**4. `# Gotchas`** — the invariants and traps, each citing a commit (see
history mining below). Omit the heading only if history genuinely
surfaced nothing.

Also add `# Key files` when a reader would otherwise not know where to
start.

### Cross-linking

**Use relative paths, not bundle-relative ones.** From
`architecture/overview.md`, link a service as
`[Payment](../services/payment.md)`.

OKF §6.1 permits both and recommends the bundle-relative form
(`](/services/payment.md)`), because a leading `/` survives a document
moving within its subdirectory. Decline that here: a leading `/` resolves
against the **bundle** root for OKF and the **repository** root for GitHub
and every other forge. Whenever the bundle sits in a subdirectory — the
normal case — every such link 404s in a browser while validating perfectly.
The validator reports it as **W9**. If the bundle *is* the repository root
the two coincide and either form works.

- Express the relationship in the
  surrounding prose, not just in the link. Links to concepts you have not written yet are
  allowed — broken links legitimately represent not-yet-written
  knowledge (§5.3).
- Aim for every code concept to link to at least one other concept. An
  orphan concept usually means the `# Dependencies` step was skipped.

### Mine git history for the "why" — and follow the reverts

For each non-trivial concept, run the per-path history helper on its
`source_files` before writing the body:

```bash
.specify/extensions/okf/scripts/bash/okf-history.sh <source-file-or-dir>
# machine-readable: add --json ; cap the list: --limit N
```

It returns the creation commit, commit count, recent subjects, and — most
valuably — **revert/hotfix/risk-flagged commits** (reverts, hotfixes,
regressions, races, deadlocks, leaks, corruption, security fixes). Those
are your gotchas and invariants.

Each flagged commit is listed with the files it touched, and a commit that
changed **only test files** is marked `[TEST-ONLY]`. **Never cite one as a
gotcha.** "Fix goroutine leak in foo_test.go" is test hygiene, not evidence
that production code leaks. Use the file list the same way for partial
matches: a race fix whose only production file sits in another package
belongs to that package's concept, not this one.

**Do not stop at the subject line.** A subject tells you something went
wrong; it rarely tells you the rule. For the two or three highest-signal
commits per concept, read the actual commit:

```bash
git show --stat <sha>          # what changed, no diff body
git show <sha> -- <path>       # the change itself (scrub secrets)
git log --follow -1 --format='%B' <sha>   # full message, often the real rationale
```

For a `Revert "X"` commit, always find and read the original X — the pair
is what carries the rule. Prefer `git blame -L <a>,<b> <file>` when you
need line-level rationale for one tricky hunk.

**Then write the rule, not the anecdote.** Several related commits usually
imply one invariant. Synthesize it:

> Bad (anecdote): "Commit `76100602564` reverted a checkpoint migration."
>
> Good (rule): "Checkpoint format changes must be forward *and* backward
> compatible, because nodes get downgraded — the V2→V3 migration was
> reverted (`76100602564`) and the V3 checksum later had to be fixed
> specifically for rollback (`bc752cdfdb0`)."

Cite every sha in `# Citations`. If history is thin or the "why" still
isn't clear, record an `open_questions` entry rather than guessing.

**Never leak secrets from history.** Historical commits and blame can
surface credentials that were later removed — describe shape, never
values, exactly as you would for current code.

### Interrogate for open questions — don't just wait to trip over one

`open_questions` should be *sought*, not only recorded when you happen to
notice a gap. Before finishing each `Service` or `Module` concept, ask
these five questions of it, and park any you cannot answer from code plus
history:

| Category | Ask |
| --- | --- |
| Guarantees | Is this timeout / retry budget / interval a hard SLA others rely on, or an implementation detail? |
| Ordering | What must happen before what, and what breaks if that order changes? |
| Failure | What happens on partial failure — retried, dropped, or left inconsistent? |
| Compatibility | What must stay stable for older/newer peers, and where is that enforced? |
| Ownership | Which team owns this, and what is the escalation path when it breaks? |

Ask them as **specific, answerable** questions ("Is the 30s node status
interval a hard SLA?"), never open-ended ones ("how does status work?").
Two or three good questions on a substantial concept is normal; zero
usually means the interrogation was skipped rather than that the code was
unambiguous.

### Index files (OKF §6)

- Write `index.md` in the bundle root and in every subdirectory.
- No frontmatter, EXCEPT the bundle root `index.md`, which carries exactly:

  ```yaml
  ---
  okf_version: "0.1"
  ---
  ```

- Body = sections of bulleted links, each entry reusing the concept's
  `description` frontmatter:

  ```markdown
  # Services

  * [Checkout Service](services/checkout.md) - Handles cart-to-order conversion and payment orchestration.

  # Data

  * [data/](data/) - Database tables and event schemas.
  ```

### `README.md` — the bundle's front door

Write one at the bundle root. OKF navigates by `index.md`, but GitHub, GitLab
and most forges render `README.md` when someone opens a directory and ignore
`index.md` entirely, so without it a reader who clicks into the bundle sees a
bare file list. The validator ignores `README.md` rather than checking it as a
concept, so it needs no frontmatter.

Keep it short and aimed at a human arriving cold:

- one line on what the directory is and that it is generated;
- a link straight to `architecture/overview.md`, and one to `index.md`;
- concept count, generator version, and the commit it was built from;
- how to check it, with `verify_okf.py`;
- **how to correct it.** Say that unresolved uncertainty is parked in
  `open_questions`, that `/speckit.okf.clarify` walks a human through those
  questions, and that an answer given there is sentinel-marked and survives
  every later regeneration. This is the highest-value thing a reader can do
  with the bundle and the only part a machine cannot produce — say so
  plainly rather than burying it.

### Log file (OKF §7)

Create `log.md` at the bundle root:

```markdown
# Knowledge Bundle Update Log

## <YYYY-MM-DD>
Commit: `<short-sha>`
* **Initialization**: Generated bundle from commit `<short-sha>` with speckit-okf. <N> concepts across <dirs>.
```

The `Commit:` line is REQUIRED and machine-checked (validator rule E4) —
it is what `/speckit.okf.update` reads to resume incrementally. Always
write it as the first line under the date heading, exactly in that
backtick-quoted form.

**Outside a git repository**, write ``Commit: `none` ``. The validator
accepts that in place of a SHA, so the bundle is still conformant. Note in
the log entry that it was generated without history, and tell the user that
incremental update stays unavailable until the project is under version
control.

## Phase 3 — Validate and report

1. Run the conformance checker:

   ```bash
   python3 .specify/extensions/okf/scripts/python/validate_okf.py <bundle_dir> --config .specify/extensions/okf/okf-config.yml
   ```

2. Fix any ERRORs (unparseable frontmatter, missing/empty `type`,
   malformed reserved files). WARNINGs (broken links, missing optional
   fields, unresolved `open_questions` — W8) are acceptable but list them.
   **W9** means you used bundle-relative links: rewrite them as relative.
3. **Verify the claims, not just the structure:**

   ```bash
   python3 .specify/extensions/okf/scripts/python/verify_okf.py <bundle_dir>
   ```

   Every FINDING is a statement the repository does not support. Fix it
   rather than explaining it away:

   - **V1/V2** — you cited a commit that does not exist, or one belonging to
     another concept. Re-run `okf-history.sh` on this concept's own
     `source_files` and cite from that.
   - **V3** — you cited a `[TEST-ONLY]` commit as a gotcha. Delete the
     claim.
   - **V4** — a symbol in `# Interfaces` does not exist. You wrote it from
     memory; grep for the real one.
   - **V5** — a `# Gotchas` section asserts invariants and cites nothing.
     Cite the commit or delete the claim.
   - **V8** — the concept describes files git does not track. Delete it and
     tell the user which subtree it came from.

   NOTEs need judgement rather than obedience: **V6** is often a real
   runtime coupling, and **V7** means you described Go packages as an import
   cycle, which the compiler forbids.
4. Report to the user: concept count by type, bundle tree, validation
   result, **how many concepts carry `open_questions`**, and suggested next
   steps:
   - review `architecture/overview.md` first;
   - run `/speckit.okf.clarify` to resolve the open questions (this is where
     the highest-value, human-only knowledge gets captured);
   - run `/speckit.okf.update` after future code changes.

## Hard rules

- Only `type` is required in frontmatter, but always provide `title` and
  `description` — indexes are useless without them.
- Reserved filenames `index.md` and `log.md` must never be used for
  concepts (§3.1).
- Concept IDs are file paths minus `.md`; use lowercase, hyphenated
  filenames.
- Every path in `source_files` must be **tracked by git**, not merely
  present on disk: `git ls-files -- <path>` must return something. The
  validator flags paths that do not exist (W6); `verify_okf.py` flags paths
  git does not track (V8). Give each concept a unique
  `type` + `title` combination to avoid duplicate-concept warnings (W7).
- Never fabricate facts about the code. If behavior is unclear from the
  source (and git history doesn't settle it), either mark it inline
  ("unverified — inferred from X") **and** add a concrete `open_questions`
  entry so `/speckit.okf.clarify` can resolve it — never guess.
- All writes stay inside `bundle_dir`. Never modify source code.
